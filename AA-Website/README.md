# AppAcademyDuplicate
This is a project attempting at designing the App Academy landing page from start to finish.
I attempted to sketch the wireframe I used 
Develop the structure of the Html
Styled it with CSS 
!There is the final design. Althrough it took me a whole 6 hours of focused work but it was worth every bit of the effort.
